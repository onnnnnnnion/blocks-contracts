BLOCKS is a fully onchain, infinite art collection on the Zora network. BLOCKS enables any block on the Zora Network to be "claimed" by a minter, in the form an NFT of that block - with only one NFT per block. To date, over 450,000 BLOCKS have been minted. BLOCKS is MIT-licensed.

The NFT media is dynamic and rendered via onchain SVG, with a unique background color based on the owner's address and text of the block number for that block. Users can also switch their NFT to display into "zorb mode", which displays their NFT with a black background and the owner's customized zorb in the top corner of the NFT. The BLOCKS contracts are deployed at the following addresses:
